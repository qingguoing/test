Forge Bundle
============

[Forge][] is a native implementation of [TLS][] (and various other
cryptographic tools) in [JavaScript][].

https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge

This repository is used to hold pre-built bundles of the [Forge][] library for
use with [Bower][] or other tools. These files are in a separate repository to
avoid accumulating large built files the main repository history.

Note that only the basic `forge.min.js` and `prime.worker.min.js` are included.
Please use the main [Forge][] project if you wish to build your own full or
custom bundles, use un-minimized sources, or require full sourcemaps.

Please see the main [Forge][] site for library documentation, installation
instructions, details on building custom bundles, and to file issues.
